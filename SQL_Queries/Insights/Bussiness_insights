I worked on this project to understand how the business is performing in terms of sales, profit, customers, and products.
The goal is to find patterns and insights that could help business decisions.

#Overall Sales Performance
The company is generating steady sales overall, but profit is not consistent across all sales. Some sales contribute much more to profit than others.
Looking only at total sales can be misleading. Profit needs to be analyzed separately to understand real performance.

#Customer Behavior
After analyzing customer-level sales:
-A small number of customers contribute a large share of total revenue and profit
-Many customers make only occasional or low-value purchases
-The business depends heavily on a small group of high-value customers.

 suggestion:
-Focus on retaining top customers with loyalty programs or special offers
-Analyze why low-value customers are not purchasing more frequently

#Product Performance
Product analysis showed that:
-Some products sell very well but generate low profit
-Other products sell less but have higher profit margins
-High-selling products are not always the most profitable.

 suggestion:
-Promote products with higher margins
-Review pricing or costs for products that sell a lot but make little profit

#Sales Trends Over Time
-Monthly sales analysis shows clear ups and downs across different months.
-Some months consistently perform better than others.
-Sales are affected by seasonality or timing, not random behavior.

 suggestion:
-Increase marketing before strong months
-Prepare inventory and staffing during peak periods

#Overall Business Takeaway
-The business can increase profit by focusing on high-margin products
-Retaining top customers can have a big impact on revenue
-Planning around seasonal trends can improve efficiency
-This analysis shows how SQL can be used not just to extract data, but to support real business decisions.
